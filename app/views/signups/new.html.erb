    SupportRoo walks you through a series of options to identify your most needed daily or routine tasks and then engages your inner circle to gift these to you just when you need it. SupportRoo allows you to receive reliable help without the discomfort of asking for it. Your inner circle can see a weekly calendar of needs, and sign up to bring dinner, walk your dog, or pay for your laundry on a given day.
